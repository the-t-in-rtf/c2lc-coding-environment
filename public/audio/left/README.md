# About These Files

These sounds were recorded for this project, see the LICENSE.txt file for terms of use.  The patch used is from the Arturia V Collection, and is a Synthi patch called "Shaker".

Each filename corresponds to the pitch of the note.  The individual sounds are meant to be sped up and slowed down to simulate a fuller range of pitches.

The 16-step sequence of notes used is (0s for unplayed, 1 for played):

1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 

The tempo of the sequence is varied by the angle, such that 45 is the slowest,
180 is the fastest, and 90 is somewhere in between.
