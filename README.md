# Coding to Learn and Create - Inclusive Coding Environment

The Inclusive Coding Environment is a new educational coding tool designed for learners with disabilities. The
Environment can be used with a mouse, touchscreen, or keyboard, and supports assistive technologies such as screen
readers. It is a web application that works in the Chrome browser.

## Installation for Developers

Running this project requires [npm and Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). Once you download or fork the source
code, you will need to install the required dependencies using a command like:

```shell
npm install
```

## Start the application

To start the app in development mode, use a command like:

```shell
npm start
```

A URL like [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) will be displayed in the console output, open that URL with
a browser to see the Coding Environment in action. The browser window will reload if you add or change files. You
will also see any lint errors in the console (see [our Contributor's guide for details](./docs/contributing.md)).
